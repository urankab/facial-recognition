# Smart Brain 

The Smart Brain application allows you to register an account and sign in using validation. The user will be able to upload images so that Smart Brain can create a box around the detected face. A user's rank goes up the more they upload.

Created using Javascript + React on the front end and Express.js + Knex.js for the backend. Clarifai API was used for face detection. 

Libraries used for front-end:
- React Particles (used for the background)
